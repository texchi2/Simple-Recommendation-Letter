abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a significant health concern worldwide. Surgery and chemo-radiotherapy are still the standard of care for HNSCC patients. The breakthrough improvement of those interventions should depend on 1) adequate surgical margin and radiotherapy guided by pathology, 2) predictive biomarkers, which are guiding a systemic therapy, and 3) holistic cancer care. The survival analysis could conclude the manifest of clinical and multiple omics data to find high-impact biomarkers. To discover cancer biomarkers, we use mass spectrometry method to analyze HNSCC. Traditionally, differential gene expression in HNSCC has been exploited to detect biomarkers. Global gene expression incor- porated with survival analysis of HNSCC are employed for the first time in 2021, to the best of our knowledge. Data retrieval and pre-processing, feature selection, sliding-window cutoff selection, Kaplan–Meier estimate, and Cox proportional haz- ard regression model are all part of the ”pvalueTex” in-house workflow. It could be utilized to find predictive biomarkers of surgical margins and to provide holistic cancer therapy. Four validated biomarkers (TMSB4X, CAMK2N1, CALML5, and FCGBP), clinical tumor size, and surgical margin status all are independent prognosis factors in HNSCC. Overexpression of TMSB4X is associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of those patients. TMSB4X knock- down in the HNSCC cell line reduced proliferation, invasion, and cervical lymph node metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, CAMK2N1, CALML5, and FCGBP, are also substantially linked with patients' OS. We must promote the concept of holistic cancer care, emphasizing the spiritual, emotional, physical, and social elements that have a critical impact on HNSCC patients' survival. The combination of holistic can- cer care and effective biomarkers will eventually lead to truly tailored personalized medicine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In lung cancer, uPA, its receptor (uPAR), and the inhibitors PAI-1 and PAI-2 of the plasminogen activator family interact with MMP-2 and MMP-9 of the MMP family to promote cancer progression. However, it remains undetermined which of these markers plays the most important role and may be the most useful indicator to stratify the patients by risk. METHODS: We determined the individual prognostic value of these 6 markers by analyzing a derivation cohort with 98 non-small cell lung cancer patients by immunohistochemical staining. The correlation between the IHC expression levels of these markers and disease prognosis was investigated, and an immunohistochemical panel for prognostic prediction was subsequently generated through prognostic model analysis. The value of the immunohistochemical panel was then verified by a validation cohort with 91 lung cancer patients. RESULTS: In derivation cohort, PAI-2 is the most powerful prognostic factor (HR = 2.30; P = 0.001), followed by MMP-9 (HR = 2.09; P = 0.019) according to multivariate analysis. When combining PAI-2 and MMP-9, the most unfavorable prognostic group (low PAI-2 and high MMP-9 IHC expression levels) showed a 6.40-fold increased risk of a poor prognosis compared to the most favorable prognostic group (high PAI-2 and low MMP-9 IHC expression levels). PAI-2 and MMP-9 IHC panel could more precisely identify high risk patients in both derivation and validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed PAI-2 as the most powerful prognostic marker among PA and MMP protease family even after considering their close relationships with each other. By utilizing a combination of PAI-2 and MMP-9, more precise prognostic information than merely using pathological stage alone can be obtained for lung cancer patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Turnaround time (TAT) is an important indicator of laboratory performance. It is often difficult to achieve fast TAT for blood tests conducted at clinics in developing countries. This is because clinics where the patient is treated are often far away from the laboratory, and transporting blood samples and test results between the two locations creates significant delay. Recent efforts have sought to mitigate this problem by using Short Message Service (SMS) to reduce TAT. Studies reporting the impact of this technique have not been published in scientific literature however. In this paper we present a study of LabPush, a system developed to test whether SMS delivery of HIV related laboratory results to clinics could shorten TAT time significantly. METHOD: LapPush was implemented in six clinics of the Kingdom of Swaziland. SMS results were sent out from the laboratory as a supplement to normal transport of paper results. Each clinic was equipped with a mobile phone to receive SMS results. The laboratory that processes the blood tests was equipped with a system for digital input of results, and transmission of results via SMS to the clinics. RESULTS: Laboratory results were received for 1041 different clinical cases. The total number of SMS records received (1032) was higher than that of paper records (965), indicating a higher loss rate for paper records. A statistical comparison of TAT for SMS and paper reports indicates a statistically significant improvement for SMS. Results were more positive for more rural clinics, and an urban clinic with high workload. CONCLUSION: SMS can be used to reduce TAT for blood tests taken at clinics in developing countries. Benefits are likely to be greater at clinics that are further away from laboratories, due to the difficulties this imposes on transport of paper records.},

abstract = {Survival analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method for discovering gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A cutoff point is usually used in survival analysis for patient dichotomization when using continuous gene expression values. There is some optimization software for cutoff determination. However, the software's predetermined cutoffs are usually set at the medians or quantiles of gene expression values. There are also few clinicopathological features available in pre-processed datasets. We applied an in-house workflow, including data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, sliding-window cutoff selection, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard modeling for biomarker discovery. In our approach for the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes to find optimal cutoff values. After adjustments with confounders, clinical tumor stage and surgical margin involvement were found to be independent risk factors for prognosis. According to the results tables that show hazard ratios with Bonferroni-adjusted p values under the optimal cutoff, three biomarker candidates, CAMK2N1, CALML5, and FCGBP, are significantly associated with overall survival. We validated this discovery by using the another independent HNSCC dataset (GSE65858). Thus, we suggest that transcriptomic analysis could help with biomarker discovery. Moreover, the robustness of the biomarkers we identified should be ensured through several additional tests with independent datasets.},

abstract = {The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome e Principe (DRSTP) consists of the two islands of Sao Tome and Principe and a number of smaller islets in the Gulf of Guinea. Sao Tome lies approximately 180 miles from Gabon on the West African coast, and the equator crosses its southern tip. The climate is tropical with two rainy seasons. The total number of inhabitants in the DRSTP is estimated to be 160,000. Due to the suitable climate, many neglected tropical parasitic diseases e.g., intestinal parasites, Schistosoma intercalatum, and Toxoplasma gondii have been found endemic in DRSTP [1,2]. Since arthropodborne parasitic diseases e.g., falciparum malaria has been long seriously endemic, the infection rate of malaria has been greatly reduced from 25{\%} in year of 2000 to less than 3{\%} in year of 2008 in DRSTP through intensive insecticide spray; and that the achievement was accomplished by the efforts of Taiwanese experts who were financially supported by Taiwan government [3-5]. Nevertheless, Lymphatic Elephantiasis (LE) cases can be still found in some inhabitants (Figure 1) who have been living in Sao Tome Island for more than 25 years; whereas LE was ignored and overshadowed by malaria for a long time in DRSTP. Although Ruiz et al. [6] has indicated such elephantiasis in STP people is possibly produced by deposits of inorganic materials in the lymph node of the lower extremities which is alternatively named of Podoconiosis; it is evidenced that in fact filarial lymphatic elephantiasis (FLE) co-exists with Podoconiosis in DRSTP because we found one FLE case in STP reporter who has filarial dance sign [7] in left inguinal region as detected by Ultrasonography with a linear array transducer at 7.5 MHz (Sonoma Health Products, Inc., CA, USA) (Figure 2). Comprehensive epidemiological investigations for STP inhabitants are urgently needed to elucidate whether FLE is commonly transmitted among rural areas. Although FLE has been regarded by World Health Organization as important Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD); until 2011, WHO designated podoconiosis as one of the 20 NTDs [8]. Since the different infection routes for Podoconiosis and FLE, measures against Podoconiosis is to prevent inhabitants walking on the soil with bare feet from the skin being penetrated by inorganic materials derived from alkaline volcanic rock; while measures against FLE including avoid mosquito's biting and take Albendazole regularly.},

We applied the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to analyze paired normal (N) and tumor (T) samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis in HNSCC cell lines to identify tumor-associated biomarkers. Our results showed a number of proteins found to be over- expressed in HNSCC. We identified thymosin beta-4 X-linked (TMSB4X) is one of the most significant candidate biomarkers. Higher TMSB4X expression in the tumor was found by N/T-paired HNSCC samples at both RNA and protein level. Overexpression of TMSB4X was found significantly associated with poor prognosis of overall survival (OS, P = 0.006) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.013) in HNSCC patients. Silencing of TMSB4X expression in HNSCC cell line reduced the proliferation and invasion ability in vitro, as well as inhibited the cervical lymph node metastasis in vivo. Altogether, our global proteomics analysis identified that TMSB4X is a newly discovered biomarker in HNSCC whose functions resulted in enhanced proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. TMSB4X may be a potential therapeutic target for treating HNSCC patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a unique and major health concern worldwide. Significant increases in glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis have been observed in HNSCC cells. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) represent a major hub in the glycolysis pathway, with GLUT4 having the highest glucose affinity. However, GLUT4's role in HNSCC has not been fully appreciated. METHODS: An in silico analysis was performed in HNSCC cohorts to identify the most significant glucose transporter associated with HNSCC patient prognosis. An immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray with samples from 90 HNSCC patients was used to determine the association of GLUT4 with prognosis. Complementary functional expression and knockdown studies of GLUT4 were performed to investigate whether GLUT4 plays a role in HNSCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The detailed molecular mechanism of the function of GLUT4 in inducing HNSCC cell metastasis was determined. RESULTS: Our clinicopathologic analysis showed that increased GLUT4 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was significantly associated with a poor overall survival (OS, P = 0.035) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.001). Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of GLUT4 in cell lines with low endogenous GLUT4 expression resulted in a significant increase in migratory ability both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the reverse phenotype was observed in GLUT4-silenced cells. Utilizing a GLUT4 overexpression model, we performed gene expression microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine that the transcription factor tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) was the main downstream regulator of GLUT4. In addition, DDX58 was confirmed to be the downstream target of TRIM24, whose downregulation is essential for the migratory phenotype induced by GLUT4-TRIM24 activation in HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identified altered glucose metabolism in the progression of HNSCC and showed that it could be partially attributed to the novel link between GLUT4 and TRIM24. This novel signaling axis may be used for the prognosis and therapeutic treatment of HNSCC in the future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The status of Toxoplasma gondii infection among primary schoolchildren (PSC) of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe (DRSTP), West Africa, remains unknown to date. METHODS: A serologic survey and risk factors associated T. gondii infection among PSC in the DRSTP was assessed by the latex agglutination (LA) test and a questionnaire interview including parents' occupation, various uncomfortable symptoms, histories of eating raw or undercooked food, drinking unboiled water, and raising pets, was conducted in October 2010. Schoolchildren from 4 primary schools located in the capital areas were selected, in total 255 serum samples were obtained by venipuncture, of which 123 serum samples were obtained from boys (9.8 +/- 1.4 yrs) and 132 serum samples were obtained from girls (9.7 +/- 1.3 yrs). RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was 63.1{\%} (161/255). No significant gender difference in seroprevalence was found between boys (62.6{\%}, 77/123) and girls (63.6{\%}, 84/132) (p = 0.9). The older age group of 10 years had insignificantly higher seroprevalence (69.9{\%}, 58/83) than that of the younger age group of 8 year olds (67.7{\%}, 21/31) (p = 0.8). It was noteworthy that the majority of seropositive PSC (75.8{\%}, 122/161) had high LA titers of {\textgreater}/=1: 1024, indirectly indicating acute or repeated Toxoplasma infection. Parents whose jobs were non-skilled workers (73.1{\%}) showed significantly higher seroprevalence than that of semiskilled- (53.9{\%}) or skilled workers (48.8{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.05). Children who had a history of raising cats also showed significantly higher seroprevalence than those who did not (p {\textless} 0.001).Children who claimed to have had recent ocular manifestation or headache, i.e. within 1 month, seemed to have insignificantly higher seroprevalence than those who did not (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Parents' educational level and cats kept indoors seemed to be the high risk factors for PSC in acquisition of T. gondii infection. While, ocular manifestation and/or headache of PSC should be checked for the possibility of being T. gondii elicited. Measures such as improving environmental hygiene and intensive educational intervention to both PSC and their parents should be performed immediately so as to reduce T. gondii infection of DRSTP inhabitants including PSC and adults.},

Surgical resection is the most common treatment modality, while there is still controversy between neck dissection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. A 25-year-old male, who had been treated for ameloblastoma of the maxilla two years ago, visited our hospital due to bleeding in the nasal and oral cavity for 2 months. Physical examination disclosed a nontender mass in the right maxillary mucobuccal fold and the magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid mass occupied in the right maxillary sinus. Enucleation combined with peripheral ostectomy was performed. Histologic examination of the excised lesion showed ameloblastic carcinoma. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was carried out. Healing was uneventful and following up showed no evidence of recurrence and distant metastasis.},

abstract = {Background: The survival analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method to discover the gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In order to utilize a continuous gene expression for survival analysis, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point by the dichotomization of the patients. There is some optimization software for cutoff determination. However, those predetermined cutoffs by software usually set at the median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) value to find a significant P-value of the Kaplan-Meier curve. There are few clinicopathological features available on their pre-processed data sets. Methods: We developed a comprehensive workflow by R script, running on the Rstudio platform. It includes data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling, and biomarker discovery. Results: Using this workflow on the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes (20,500) programmatically. After adjustment with other confounders, we found that the clinical tumor stage and the surgical margin involvement are independent risk factors in patient survival. According to the resulting tables with Bonferroni adjusted P-value under optimal cutoff as well as hazard ratio ({\&}gt;=1.5), there were ten candidate biomarkers, named as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1, which are significantly associated with the poor prognosis of overall survival (OS). At the same time, the other ten genes were over-expressed in the better survival patients (with hazard ratio {\&}lt;=0.5), named as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB. Further validations are warranted.Conclusions: We suggested this analysis tool equipped with an optimal cutoff finder will help with biomarker discovery of protein-coding genes, in terms of tumor-agnostic therapy.},

abstract = {Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have extensive biological-applications because of their bio-compatibility, tunable optical properties and their ability to be excited by infrared radiation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play important roles in extracellular matrix remodelling; they are usually found to significantly increase during cancer progression, and these increases may lead to poor patient survival. In this study, we produced a biosensor that can be recognized by MMP2 and then be unravelled by the attached quencher to emit visible light. We used 3.5-nm gold nanoparticles as a quencher that absorbed emission from UCNPs at a wavelength of 540 nm. The biosensor consists of an upconversion nanoparticle, MMP2-recognized polypeptides and quenchers. Here, UCNPs consisting of NaYF4:Yb(3+)/Er(3+) were prepared via a high temperature co-precipitation method while protecting the oleic acid ligand. To improve the biocompatibility and modify the UCNPs with a polypeptide, they were coated with a silica shell and further conjugated with MMP-recognizing polypeptides. The polypeptide has two ends of featuring carboxylic and thiol groups that react with UCNPs and AuNPs, and the resulting nanoparticles were referred to as UCNP@p-Au. According to the in vitro cell viability analysis, UCNP@p-Au exhibited little toxicity and biocompatibility in head and neck cancer cells. Cellular uptake studies showed that the MMP-based biosensor was activated by 980-nm irradiation to emit green light. This MMP-based biosensor may serve as sensitive and specific molecular fluorescent probe in biological-applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016 AACR. Epigenetic correlates of the head and neck cancer may illuminate its pathogenic roots. Through a gene set enrichment analysis, we found that the oncogenic transcription factor RUNX2 is widely upregulated in the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with lymph node metastasis, where it also predicts poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Enforced expression of ectopic RUNX2 promoted the metastatic capabilities of HNSCC, whereas RUNX2 silencing inhibited these features. Mechanistic investigations showed that manipulating levels of activin A (INHBA) could rescue or compromise the RUNX2-mediated metastatic capabilities of HNSCC cells. Furthermore, we found that miR-376c-3p encoded within the 3′-untranslated region of RUNX2 played a pivotal role in regulating RUNX2 expression in highly metastatic HNSCC cells, where it was downregulated commonly. Restoring miR-376c expression in this setting suppressed expression of RUNX2/INHBA axis along with metastatic capability. Clinically, we observed an inverse relationship between miR-376c-3p expression and the RUNX2/INHBA axis in HNSCC specimens. In summary, our results defined a novel pathway in which dysregulation of the RUNX2/INHBA axis due to miR-376c downregulation fosters lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.},
